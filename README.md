# 42-Hackathon-BuildTheBay

**"Build the Bay"** was a week-long hackathon that was hosted here at [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.us.org/). It was designed to help make a difference in the Bay Area community. The focus was to use tech to help a local cause. This includes helping local nonprofits, charities, or family-owned local businesses, details [here](https://www.42.us.org/42-hosts-first-build-the-bay-hackathon/).

I was part of a 5 man team "**October's Very Own**", composed of [Aymen Kharroubi](https://github.com/akharrou),  [Christopher Ford](https://github.com/Chris7Ford), [Joseph Kaplin](https://github.com/jkaplin), [Kevin Colour](https://github.com/MrColour), and [myself](https://github.com/akharrou).

We built a Restaurant E-Guide that focuses on the needs of local restaurants. Specifically, we wanted to emphasize the positive experiences that people have had at restaurants in the Newark area.

We built the website using MERN stack, **Mango** for the Data Base, **Express** Framework, **React** Frontend and webpages, **Node.js**.

To start our server you should install nodemon and npm. On the root folder start the backend server with `nodemon backend/server.js` then go into the `frontend` directory and run `npm start`. This will run our project on the local host.
